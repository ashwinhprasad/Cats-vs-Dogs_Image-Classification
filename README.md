# Cats vs Dogs

This repository contains the implementation of cats vs dogs Image Classification which has been done in tensorflow.
the Image Dataset was collected from : https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765

There are 3 files in this repository 

1. ImageDataset.ipynb - This is used to preprocess the images and convert them into numpy arrays so that they can be used later
2. Model.ipynb - The images are then loaded to this file where the neural network was trained 
3. catsvsdogs1.h5 - this file contains the saved model for cats vs dogs which can be used later to make predictions

## Thank You
